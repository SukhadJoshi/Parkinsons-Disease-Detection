# Parkinsons-Disease-Detection
Finding out if a patient has Parkinson's disease or not is the goal of this project. SVM (Support Vector Machine) was applied to the data to distinguish between various parameters, such as vocal frequency of various people, in order to categorize the diseased patient. Data sets of various patients were taken from Kaggle. I worked on the project using Google Colab.
